In this project, I queried the sample Sakila DVD Rental database provided by PostgreSQL at https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as patterns in movie watching across different customer groups, how each group compares on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
